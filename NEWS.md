# targets 0.0.0.9002

## Breaking changes

* Add a new `size` field to the metadata to allow `targets` to make better judgments about when to rehash files (#180). We now compare hashes to check file size differences instead of doing messy floating point comparisons with ad hoc tolerances. It breaks back compatibility with old projects, but the error message is informative, and this is all still before the first official release.
* Change "local" to "main" and "remote" to "worker" in the `storage`, `retrieval`, and `deployment` settings (#183, @mattwarkentin).
* Ensure function dependencies are sorted before computing the function hash (GitHub commit f15face7d72c15c2d1098da959492bdbfcddb425).

## Bug fixes

* Stop sending target return values over the network when `storage` is `"remote"` (#182, @mattwarkentin).
* Shorten lengths of warnings and error messages to 128 characters (#186, @gorkang).

## New features

* Add a new function `tar_bind()` to combine pipeline objects.

# targets 0.0.0.9000

* First version.
