# targets 0.0.0.9003

## Breaking changes

* Make patterns composable (#212, @glep, @djbirke).
* Allow workspaces to load unexportable objects (#214).
* Make workspace files super light by saving only a reference to the required dependencies (#214).
* Add a new `workspace` argument to `tar_option_set()` to specify which targets will save their workspace files during `tar_make()` (#214).
* Change `error = "save"` to `error = "workspace"` to so it is clearer that saving workspaces no longer duplicates data (#214). 

# targets 0.0.0.9002

## Breaking changes

* Add a new `size` field to the metadata to allow `targets` to make better judgments about when to rehash files (#180). We now compare hashes to check file size differences instead of doing messy floating point comparisons with ad hoc tolerances. It breaks back compatibility with old projects, but the error message is informative, and this is all still before the first official release.
* Change "local" to "main" and "remote" to "worker" in the `storage`, `retrieval`, and `deployment` settings (#183, @mattwarkentin).
* Ensure function dependencies are sorted before computing the function hash (GitHub commit f15face7d72c15c2d1098da959492bdbfcddb425).
* Move `garbage_collection` to a target-level setting, i.e. argument to `tar_target()` and `tar_option_set()` (#194). Previously was an argument to the `tar_make*()` functions.
* Allow `tar_name()` and `tar_path()` to run outside the pipeline with debugging-friendly default return values.

## Bug fixes

* Stop sending target return values over the network when `storage` is `"remote"` (#182, @mattwarkentin).
* Shorten lengths of warnings and error messages to 128 characters (#186, @gorkang).
* Restrict in-memory metadata to avoid incorrectly recycling deleted targets (#191).
* Serialize unexportable dependencies before sending them to workers. Transport data through `target$subpipeline` rather than `target$cache` to make that happen (#209, @mattwarkentin).

## New features

* Add a new function `tar_bind()` to combine pipeline objects.
* Add `tar_seed()` to get the random number generator seed of the target currently running.

## Enhancements

* Allow target-specific `future::plan()`s through the `resources` argument of `tar_target()` (#198, @mattwarkentin).
* Use `library()` instead of `require()` in `command_load_packages()`.
* Evaluate commands directly in `targets$cache$targets$envir` to improve convenience in interactive debugging (`ls()` just works now.) This is reasonably safe now that the cache is populated at the last minute and cleared as soon as possible (#209, #210).

# targets 0.0.0.9000

* First version.
