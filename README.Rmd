The `targets` package is a [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. With `targets`, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. `targets` learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data. For deep dives into why and how to use `targets`, as well as help transitioning from [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), please see the [user manual](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual).

## Installation

Install the GitHub development version to access the latest features and patches.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("wlandau/targets")
```

## Get started

The easiest way to quickly get started is to read the [walkthrough chapter of the user manual](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/walkthrough.html). You might also watch the recorded talks linked below.

## Help

* Post to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wlandau/targets/issues) to elicit help from the maintainer.
* The [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) forum is full of friendly enthusiasts of R and the tidyverse. Use the [`targets` tag](https://community.rstudio.com/tag/targets).
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) broadcasts to the entire open source community. Use the [`targets-r-package` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/targets-r-package).

## Documentation

* [User manual](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual): in-depth discussion about how to use `targets`.
* [Reference website](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/): formal documentation of all user-side functions, the statement of need, and multiple design documents of the internal architecture.
* [Developer documentation](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-design): software design documents for developers contributing to the deep internal architecture of `targets`.

## Examples

## The R Targetopia

The R Targetopia consists of specialized workflow frameworks tailored to individual fields of Statistics and data science, and they use domain knowledge to abstract away most of the careful planning and engineering typically required to write pipelines. They leverage the full power of [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) while requiring minimal expertise with [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) itself. Examples include [`stantargets`](https://github.com/wlandau/stantargets) and [`tarchetypes`](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes).

## Apps

* [`tar_watch()`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/reference/tar_watch.html): a built-in Shiny app to visualize progress while a pipeline is running.
* [`targetsketch`](https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/targetsketch): a Shiny app to help sketch pipelines ([app](https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/targetsketch), [source](https://github.com/wlandau/targetsketch)).
